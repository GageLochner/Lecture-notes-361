# Week 7 lecture notes

## Grading

Lab 1 grades in. 

Commit time is what is graded, not pull time.

## Pointers from different angles

### Array pointers

Single pointer case is pretty clear.

2d array is just a list of pointers. Malloc just pulls each array, the loop pulls for each line in array.

*** used to pull in a matrix. It's a pointer to the 2 pointers for each location. 

Just pointer - just address of memory. Usually the value that it holds.

* pointer - derefferance operator, goes to memory address that it's pointing to and read that.

& pointer - address of the pointer.
