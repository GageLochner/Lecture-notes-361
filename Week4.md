# Week 4

## C

Run `gcc file.here` to compile

Run `a.out` to see output if not otherwise named.

End lines in semicolons. 

## Writing C 101

1. Comment everything
2. Plan first, code second
	* Constants to declare, variables to be used, ect.
	* Operations per input is how to measure compelxity 
3. Write test case first
	* What is the expected outcome?
4. Write code one line at a time and TEST
	* Best way to prevent loss of sleep
5. Write test cases and expected outcomes, then try them

Make sure code terminates. 

## Hellow world expanded

`%d\n` sets up for decimal number on new line in printf.

`scanf` is the read function in C.

`&` is the pointer to the variable. `&i` sends the input to variable i. 

Print inputs back out to verify input. Refered to as diagnostic printf.

Bad form can lead to errors later. 

`==` comparison instead of assignment. 

emacs will highlight bracket pairs, and will auto indent correctly. 

Floating point is the real numbers for C. 

Make sure floating points don't get rounded inproperly.
