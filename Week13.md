Partner : rrydberg@iastate.edu - Robert

Unsaved local files may be written over. 

## Matrix storage 

### COO algorythm 

`typedef struct matrix {`

Write functino for test case first.

You can always comment out code.

Initialize matrix in main. 

Use `srand(time(0));` to generate random numbers. Include time.h

` r = rand()%100; // r is a random number less than 100`

Assorted code for random number generator into test matrix. Uses time intervals to find zero values, but also total number of nnz to get desired matrices. 

Also uses struct to define the matrix.
